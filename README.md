# :christmas_tree: Advent of Code (2020)

## What is Advent of Code?

_Excerpt from the Advent of Code [website](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about);_

    "Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets
    and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a
    speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or
    to challenge each other."
    
## About
After much deliberation I (anti-climatically) decided to take the same approach as 
[last year](https://github.com/TomPlum/advent-of-code-2019) and take my time with each puzzle by taking a more
enterprise-style test-driven approach in Kotlin as I really enjoyed it.
